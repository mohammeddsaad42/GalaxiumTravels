# PostToolUse (write tools) — type-check Python edits and stash the result.
#
# PostToolUse stdout is discarded by design, so printing mypy output here would
# be invisible to the agent. Instead this writes failures to a stash file that
# the UserPromptSubmit hook (inject-pending.sh) prints on the next turn, where
# stdout IS injected. Two hooks, one feedback loop: the agent sees its own type
# errors and fixes them without being asked.
#
# Touched files are recorded separately by record-tool.sh, which sees every
# tool call -- this hook only concerns itself with type checking.
